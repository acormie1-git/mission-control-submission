# 🚀 Mission Control — Backend API Engineering Challenge

Welcome! This repository contains a take-home backend API assessment designed to evaluate your API design, data modeling, system architecture, and testing skills.

Your goal is to build a backend service that consumes public data from the NASA Image and Video Library API and exposes your own well-designed REST (or GraphQL) API with meaningful functionality.

The NASA Image and Video Library API provides searchable metadata, images, videos, and audio from NASA’s public archives. No authentication is required.

NASA Image & Video Library API Documentation:  
[https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)

Base URL:
https://images-api.nasa.gov

Example Available Endpoints:

- `GET /search?q={query}` — Search NASA media
- `GET /asset/{nasa_id}` — Retrieve asset manifest
- `GET /metadata/{nasa_id}` — Retrieve metadata
- `GET /captions/{nasa_id}` — Retrieve caption files

You are free to use any endpoints available in the NASA Image and Video Library API.

<details> <summary><strong>✏️ Integrate with at Least 3 NASA Endpoints</strong></summary> <br>

Your implementation must integrate with **at least three different endpoints** from the NASA Image and Video Library API.

Below are example feature ideas:

---

### Example: Enhanced Media Search

GET /media/search

Wrap NASA’s `/search` endpoint and:

- Normalize the response structure  
- Support filters (year, media_type, keywords)  
- Limit and paginate results  
- Sort by date  

---

### Example: Media Detail Aggregator

GET /media/:nasa_id

Combine data from:

- `/asset/{nasa_id}`
- `/metadata/{nasa_id}`

Return a single enriched object including:
- Title  
- Description  
- Media URLs  
- Date created  
- Photographer or NASA center  
- Related keywords  

---

### Example: Yearly Archive Summary

GET /analytics/year/:year

Return:
- Total media items for that year  
- Breakdown by media type (image, video, audio)  
- Top 5 most common keywords  

---

### Example: Topic Insights

GET /analytics/topic/:keyword

Return:
- Total matching media results  
- Oldest and newest items  
- Distribution by media type  

---

### Example: Dashboard Endpoint

GET /dashboard

Expose a combined view including:
- Most recent Mars-related image  
- Total results for “Apollo”  
- Media type distribution for a chosen keyword  

---

You are encouraged to design your own endpoints if they demonstrate similar complexity and thoughtful data modeling.

<details> <summary><strong>📘 Documentation</strong></summary> <br>

Create a second `README.md` in your submission repository that should include:

### 📌 Setup Instructions
- How to install dependencies  
- How to run the application  
- How to run tests  

### 📌 API Endpoints
For each endpoint you create:
- URL  
- Method  
- Description  
- Example request  
- Example response  

### 📌 Design Decisions
- Why you chose your framework  
- Project structure  
- Performance or scaling considerations  
- Trade-offs made  
- What you would improve with more time  

</details>


<details> <summary><strong>🧪 [BONUS] Testing</strong></summary> <br>

Include tests that cover your API integrations:

- Valid responses  
- Edge cases  
- Error handling  
- Invalid inputs  

Tests may be unit tests, integration tests, or both.

## ⏱ Time Expectation

We estimate this challenge should take **3–6 hours**, depending on your familiarity with the stack you choose.

Focus on clarity and thoughtful design — it’s not about finishing every possible feature. Show us how you think.



Have fun with it, and we look forward to seeing your solution! 🚀
